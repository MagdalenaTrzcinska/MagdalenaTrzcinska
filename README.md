### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Magda.

I started my IT studies with Java. For 3 years I did basic projects in this language. However, the back-end was not satisfactory enough for me. With a bit of free time, I found front-end technologies and fell in love! Colours, shapes, gradients in web design are what I would like to do in life.
